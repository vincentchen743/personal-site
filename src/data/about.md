# Intro

I am a computer science student at UNSW, previously studying data science. Currently, I am working at Atlassian as a Data Science Intern where I analyse data to help understand features of products, with the goal of discovering actionable insights. I am particularly interested in how technology benefit people, in sectors such as health, software and social impact. 

Outside of work, I like playing volleyball, weightlifting and watching anime & TV shows. I also have a goal of watching the top 150 IMDB movies.
